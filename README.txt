wgetflv is a collection of bash scripts to download flash videos from popular
online video websites.

The scripts run on Linux. They require some of the common text processing tools
such as sed and grep.  Some require MP4Box to concatenate mp4 files. The only
uncommon requirement is my binreplace, which can be downloaded from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/binreplace/.  Usage and command line syntax are
better documented in the scripts themselves.

Video web sites change their html code frequently, so be prepared to get
disappointed.
